    ```html
      <div class="alert alert--danger">
        <div class="alert__title"> awesome title </div>
      </div>
    ```
    alert -> block
      alert--danger -> modifier 
        alert__title  -> element is part of the block a block can have many elements
      

This does not includes a grid I belive CSS grid is far more powerful tool.
